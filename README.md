## Comment App

This application allows users to create a thread of comments where they can reply to one another's comments. Users are also able to thumbs up or thumbs down a comment in the thread. Alongside this, users can even delete their comments that are in the thread. I built this application using React and deploying it through Netlify.

## Getting Started

Clone or download this repo onto your local machine. Once you have done this, install the node packages. You can do this by running ```npm i``` on your command line tool.


## Running the app

After you have installed all of the dependencies that are needed for this project, you can open the project up through your command line tool. First be in the root of the directory and then run ```npm run start``` in your command line tool. This will start the React app server, opening the application.


## Stopping the app

To stop running the server and the react app, you can hit ```command + z``` to close both.


## Tests

To run the tests for the application run the command ```npm run test```.
